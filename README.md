Project Description

Every year, school test results play a role in deciding the fate of millions of students. 
In America, the SAT is a major part of the college admissions process.

In this project, I will work with a SQL database containing test performance from NYC's public schools.
I look at: 
- How performance varies by borough
- I Identify how many schools fail to report information
- Find the top ten performing schools across the city! And More!
